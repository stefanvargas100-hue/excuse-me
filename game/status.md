# Status

**Updated:** 2026-11-08, by Claude Opus 5.5
**Lead branch:** `stefanvargas100-hue/Update-Test`
**Live version:** see `main`; the studio setup merged there on 2026-11-08 with no game code changes

## Now
- **Round:** 1, at step 6 of the playbook.
- **In progress:** the Codex pilot, `rounds/round-01/batch-01-fit-check.md`.
- **Waiting on the Director:** nothing.

## Next action
Review the pilot when it reports, including how well Codex followed the process. Only then start the batch for idea 2.

## Worth knowing
- Codex has not yet been run through this process. Confirm during the pilot that it follows `AGENTS.md`, reports back and stays in scope.
- Check what a worker loads at startup during the pilot. Global skills and tools may add context no repo layout can remove.
- The CI test workflow runs on pushes to the lead branch and on PRs. Only `main` deploys.
